# ThinksterNgBasicChallenge

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.1.

## Directions:
Everything is done focusing on [Putting The Basics Together tutorial](https://thinkster.io/tutorials/fundamentals-of-angular-getting-started/exercise-putting-the-basics-together).

* Create a new Angular application
* In the AppComponent
    * Display the movie posters of 4 movie flops
    * Place a button for each one to vote for it
    * When a button is clicked, disable all of the buttons
    * Also, display a message next to the chosen poster that says "Chosen!"
* Bonus Challenge - Enable changing your vote
    * Change the text of the clicked button to "Unvote" and don't disable it
    * If it is clicked again to "unvote" then re-enable the other buttons, remove the "Chosen!" message and change the button text back to "Vote" so that you can change your vote.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
